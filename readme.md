## Cryptographic Democracy Vision ##
Create organizations and distributed entities secured by cryptography.

Manage organizations as a private blockchain; Notaries, lawyers and auditors are replaced by digital signatures, hashes and consensus algorithms.

### Why this is needed ###
Establishing an organization is difficult, cumbersome and expensive. If you wish to exist in more than one jurisdiction, the difficulty is compounded.

### How this works ###
We create a specification to describe organizations structure and bylaws, and tools to manage those organizations as private blockchains in a distributed, decentralized manner.
